            <em>Developper <strong>full stack</strong></em>

            <P>I learn MERN development, I love coding and I started learning at the end of 2019(during the COVID crisis), since this day I progress all days and I have learning a ton of things.
                I started by coding video games on 'lua'(I discover 'gamecoder.fr' at my beginning), after I have learning C# with monogames.
                Then i decide to find a real formation in development then i started to learn Web Coding (end of year 2021).
                Since i have learning html, css, scss, javascript, php, symfony, jQuery...
                I really liked Javascript then i decided to learn coding app in full javascript and I started to learn MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js for becomming a fullStack developper.
                I code and learn every day and I think I will be able to create MERN applications alone and easily within a few months.
